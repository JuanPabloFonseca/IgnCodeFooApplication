# IgnCodeFooApplication

At the time I write this, the deadline for the Application has already passed. However, I feel that it is appropiate to describe the repository a bit, for IGN and for anybody who stumbles upon it.

In the repository you can find two folders, one called numberboggle (which corresponds to question 3 of the application), and another one weirdly called pruebaleerjsondeurl (which corresponds to question 4, first option, of the application). For those of you who do not know what those questions are, you can go to http://www.ign.com/code-foo/2017/ where the questions are described.

All the code is mainly in Java (with a bit of SQL and XML hidden inside some Strings).

For questions 1 and 2 of the application,
1. The link to my video is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgYa29_7syc
2. The link to my Lincoln Log reasoning is https://docs.google.com/document/d/1beBAIdkaiT0oeFRzjO_0lYDu5p-SZ30k87ieuEk7ZXU/edit?usp=sharing

Feel free to ask me any questions or use the code!! Have a nice day!!
